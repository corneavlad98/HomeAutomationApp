# HomeAutomationApp
User interface of app is developed in Android Studio.

Raspberry Pi is the backend of the app that runs Python scripts to send/receive data to and from the Real Time DataBase. The RPI has connected to it LEDs, a temperature sensor (DHT11) and a Z-Wave module that provides connection to Z-Wave devices (in my case, a smart socket and a temperature/humidity sensor)

Firebase is used to link the two and provide real-time data about the DHT11 sensor and LEDs.

Here is how the main menu of the app looks like:
